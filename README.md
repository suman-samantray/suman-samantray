## Hi there 👋

🔬 I’m currently working as a **Research Associate** at [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)](https://www.pnnl.gov), specializing in **molecular simulations**, **quantum chemistry**, and **AI-driven modeling**.  
⚛️ Focused on **enzyme catalysis**, **biomolecular transport**, and **programmable biomaterials** for health and sustainability.  
🖥️ Developer of **multiscale modeling frameworks** integrating *molecular dynamics*, *QM/MM*, and *machine learning* to connect atomic-scale interactions with material function.  
🧬 Research spans **protein–ligand interactions**, **tunnel energetics**, and **disordered biomolecular systems** at interfaces.  
🛠️ Background in **chemical engineering**, **computational chemistry**, and **scientific software development**, creating reproducible and scalable tools for the scientific community.

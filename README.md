## Hi there 👋

🔬 I’m currently working as Research Associate at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (USA), specializing in molecular simulations, quantum chemistry, and AI-driven modeling.\n
⚛️ Focused on enzyme catalysis, biomolecular transport, and programmable biomaterials for health and sustainability.\n
🖥️ Developer of multiscale modeling frameworks integrating molecular dynamics, QM/MM, and machine learning to connect atomic-scale interactions with material function.\n
🧬 Research spans protein–ligand interactions, tunnel energetics, and disordered biomolecular systems at interfaces.\n
🛠️ Chemical engineering, computational chemistry, and scientific software development background, creating reproducible and scalable tools for the scientific community.
